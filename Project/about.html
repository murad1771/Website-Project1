            <p> 
                After learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript from CodeAcademy, we started working on our website. The work was divided into 4 parts 
                (Main Page, Information about our team members, Information about our Hour of Code project and Information about our Website project )
                each member taking one of the responsibilities.
