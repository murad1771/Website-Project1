<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Process</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">We started the event by introducing ourselves and presenting slides
about ADA University and answered students' questions about our
SITE school, financial aid and the process of applying here. After, we
showed them slides about Hour of Code and explained the main
purpose and goal of this project. Even pupils who said that their
dream major is not related to Computer Science, admitted that
they were excited to start this activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">During the event, we explained them how to solve the puzzles and
answered their questions. They were actively raising their hands to
tell their solutions and ask for help, if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We received a lot of positive feedback from them and
we think that our goal to inspire them to start coding and introduce
them to the Computer related study fields was accomplished.</p>
